# Project 

## Sponsor: 3D Animation Club - Sahil Samar
Contact Information - (858)859-5095
## Our Project Idea
Provide a webpage for the 3D animation club for the club as a whole. Current members of the club as well as members looking to join the 3d animation club can visit this site for initiation as well as guidance for what to do. On here we are looking to provide scheduling, a way for the leaders to reach out, and of course resources/guides for people to use in Blender and Unity programs. 
- Calender for meetings
- 3D Dev portfolio with works from students
- Blog/Introduction page
- Database with instruction videos
- Installation tutorials/ interface tutorials for Unity and Blender

We are also looking to implement an Admin login system so the leaders of the club can enter the site and make changes accordingly

## Deployment Plans
We will deploy the website using AWS because we do not have Rasberry Pi. Our deployment manager is Matthew Cao-Manaka. 
Currently we are already in progress in working out the deployment, however we are not completely done.
Matthew is hoping to finish deployment in the next week by April 1st, Friday.
